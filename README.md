### General Information

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and funtionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own.

### Goals and Requirements

My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
